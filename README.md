you can enter "fileName".txt or just "fileName" (Make sure the .txt file are in the directory with the oop.jar)

It will ask you this twice.

then it will ask you Enter Shingle Size. 

When your all done and back at the main menu press 2 to end the program.

# Quick Test:

To test the Program quickly use the test files provided

Use TestA.txt and TestB.txt with a Shingle Size of 1
	
	Result should be a Similarity of 25%
	
Use Test1.txt and Test2.txt with a Shingle Size of 3
	
	Result should be a Similarity of 20%
